## Water Management Solution Mobile App

### About this project
It is an IoT-based mobile application for the Smart Water Management project at Gyelposhing Town, Bhutan. This app is designed for use by the water management team and enables users to monitor the water level in tanks, flow rate at individual nodes, check water quality, and control the opening and closing of valves. With improved monitoring capabilities, the team can expect greater efficiency and reduced manual labor.

My role for the project was mobile application developer.
